# 2D-Mesh-Pathfinder
A collaborator and I made this Python code to find the path between the user's two chosen points. We created the code for the nm_pathfinder.py file, and our professor provided the other files. 

First, we implemented a Breadth-First Search Algorithm to find the path between two points. Then, we switched around some of the code to implement Dijkstra's Algorithm which created a faster path to each point. Finally, we changed our code to follow an A* Search Algorithm which was much more efficient for the pathfinding.
